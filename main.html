			Whether as a director or as an actor, Rishab Shetty has always strived to step out of his comfort zone. The filmmaker, who spoke to CE ahead of the release of his upcoming directorial, Kantara, asserted that he is a person who does not believe in ‘Luck by Chance’, and rather enjoys going that extra mile, and giving his maximum effort while leaving the result to take its own course.
